When building an APK to upload to google you must first make sure it’s signed and increase the version numbers. 

File > Build Settings > Player Settings > Publishing Settings > AndroidLogo

Here there’s a button to browse for a keystone, do this and find user.keystore in the github root folder.

The Keystore password is: gp3best

You must then select the Key alias below called: scribble defence
With the password: gp3best

You can now build the APK signed (meaning not a debuggable build which google doesn’t accept)

To increase the version number (required by google for each upload) go to:
File > Build Settings > Player Settings > Publishing Settings > AndroidLogo

Go to the Other Settings tab
The “bundle version” is the build version “1.0.4” incremement in a logical way:
1.0.4.5 - hot patch for a tiny problem
1.0.5 - small fixes and builds
1.1.0 - big changed, new modes/new maps

The “bundle version code” is just an integer “6” increment for every build you make regardless of importance.
